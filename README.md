# StringCalc


Simple string calculator, used it to experiment with sorting through lists in order to complete BEDMAS in the proper order.

Can complete exponents, addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction. Never had the time to get to rounded brackets and square brackets; but still a fun project and had fun doing it.
